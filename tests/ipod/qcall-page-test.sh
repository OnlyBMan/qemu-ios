# debug access for a page that isn't plain RAM there. tests/ipod/qcall-page.S, run as each board's bootrom
# (tests/ipod/bare-rom.sh), issues QC_GLES_PING with the block in one page (the reference), across a page boundary
# whose physical pages are in the opposite order (from SVC and from User mode), with its second page unmapped, and in a
# privileged read-only page (from SVC, and from User mode, which may not access it), and checks each reply is the
# reference's (none for the unmapped one, and no fault; none for User mode in the privileged page).
# QEMU= selects the binary (default build/qemu-system-arm).
